**Who am I?**

I'm Harsh Bhatia. I live in Gwalior, India with a lot of computers. I was introduced to programming when I was 16 (C++) and I hated it back then, but had to do it anyway as it was a part of my curriculum. Later after getting into a college I learned [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) and fell in love with code, now a days I code in Python, JavaScript, and Java to develop some awesome websites and Android Apps.
					I consider myself a slightly experienced full-stack web developer who also does android development when needed (although I am still new to it).



When I am not coding, I might be found playing tunes on my guitar or my piano or trying to sing. I have a serious interest in Indian classical music, which I keep looping on my playlist.

**Why do I blog?**
I needed a way to keep track of software development over time â€“ whatever I am thinking about or working on. That's what this blog is basically for.

**How can I contact you?**
I love hand written emails:
